Think of all the things that spin and twirl around us. Cricket balls, rollercoasters, spinning dancers, ceiling fans, wheels and so on. In this task, we are going to ask you to imagine rotating things as fast as possible. Let us first get the hang of this task. Below, you will see a clip of ceiling fan rotating. Close your eyes and try to imagine the fan rotating in your mind’s eye.

Fantastic, you are good to go ahead!
